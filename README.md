# Hands-On Shared Config Center Repo 

A **centralized Git-based configuration repository** designed to store, version, and manage configuration files across multiple environments, platforms, and applications. 

This repository serves as a middleware layer for configuration management and can support **Spring Cloud Config**, **AWS Parameter Store**, **Kubernetes ConfigMaps/Secrets**, and other future configuration platforms. It also integrates naturally with **GitOps workflows**.
